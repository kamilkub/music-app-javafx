# music-app-javafx
Really simple music desktop application written using JavaFX. <br>
Built back then when I was interested in JavaFX. <br>
Now it's kind of souvenir from when I started.<br>
Keep in mind it will be all messy, reworking this project now would be a waste of time. <br>


To set-up the project and make it work first off download this library:<br>
<code>https://jar-download.com/?search_box=jfoenix</code>

<br>
Extract the archive and add it to the Project Structure<br>

<code>File > Project Structure > Libraries > + > !Selecte path of the jar you've extracted! </code>
